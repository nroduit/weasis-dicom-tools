# Security Policy

weasis-dicom-tools is a Java DICOM toolkit (DICOM network SCU/SCP, transcoding,
de-identification/masking, presentation states, LUTs, DICOMWeb clients) consumed
by Weasis, Karnak, and weasis-pacs-connector. Because it processes medical-imaging
data that may contain sensitive health information (PHI/PII) and runs inside
hospital-facing applications, we take security issues seriously and appreciate
responsible disclosure.

## Supported Versions

The artifact version tracks the underlying dcm4che release (e.g. `5.34.x`).
Security fixes are provided for the latest released version. We recommend always
running the most recent release.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.34.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 5.34  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately using one of the following channels:

- **Preferred:** Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-dicom-tools/security/advisories/new)
  via GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature.
- Alternatively, email the maintainer at **nicolas.roduit@gmail.com**.

Please include as much of the following as you can to help us triage quickly:

- The type of issue (e.g. injection, path traversal, exposure of PHI, insecure
  de-identification/masking, SSRF via DICOMWeb/WADO, TLS/certificate handling,
  XML external entity, etc.).
- The affected component(s) and version (DICOM network SCU/SCP, transcoder /
  image pipeline, de-identification / mask area op, STOW-RS/WADO/QIDO clients,
  hanging-protocol parsing, etc.).
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code, if available.
- The impact, including how an attacker might exploit it.

**Do not include real patient data** in your report. Use synthetic or fully
anonymized DICOM data only.

## Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days**.
- We will investigate and provide an initial assessment within **10 business
  days**, and keep you informed of progress toward a fix.
- Once a fix is available, we will coordinate a release and a public advisory.
  We are happy to credit you in the advisory unless you prefer to remain
  anonymous.

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before
any public disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers the weasis-dicom-tools library and its source code in this
repository. Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (dcm4che, OpenCV /
weasis-core-img, etc.) should be reported to the respective upstream projects;
if a dependency issue affects weasis-dicom-tools, feel free to let us know so we
can update.

Thank you for helping keep weasis-dicom-tools and its users safe.
